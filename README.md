# My #100DaysOfCode Challenge(s)

Here's where I'll record my #100DaysOfCode Rounds, and hopefully gain a lot of coding knowledge that will help me achieve my goals and dreams of becoming a pro developer :)

Some things I'm interested in:

+ Android Development (Kotlin, Flutter) ***CURRENTLY WORKING ON :)***
+ Game Development (Unity)
+ Version Control (Git)
